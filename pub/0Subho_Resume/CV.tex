\section{Research Objective}
	My research interests include Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Fog Computing, Next Generation Networks and Performance Modeling of Network and Communication System. Particularly I am interested in network management and future network architecture using SDN and NFV. So far I have worked on the scalability issues that arise during deployment of SDN to provide network management to the large scale networks consisting of Internet of things (IoT) devices. I have developed multiple ``orchestration" frameworks that automate the deployment challenges and provide fault and partition tolerance to the system. I am particularly interested in developing a management-free and future-proof network architecture. My approach is to identify a systems problem, reduce it to its core by stripping away unnecessary details, and look for clean conceptual solutions. Such an approach often clarifies the issue and shows possible connections to other areas where we can borrow ideas and develop innovative solutions.
