abstract = {Software switches are pivotal in the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm, particularly in the early phases of development, deployment and testing. Currently, the most popular one is Open vSwitch (OVS), leveraged in many production-based environments. However, due to its kernel-based nature, OVS is typically complex to modify when additional features or adaptation is required. To this regard, a simpler user-space is key to perform these modifications. In this article, we present a rich overview of BOFUSS, the basic OpenFlow user-space software switch. BOFUSS has been widely used in the research community for diverse reasons, but it lacked a proper reference document. For this purpose, we describe the switch, its history, architecture, uses cases and evaluation, together with a survey of works that leverage this switch. The main goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the switch and its characteristics. Although the original BOFUSS is not expected to surpass the high performance of OVS, it is a useful complementary artefact that provides some OpenFlow features missing in OVS and it can be easily modified for extended functionality. Moreover, enhancements provided by the BEBA project brought the performance from BOFUSS close to OVS. In any case, this paper sheds light to researchers looking for the trade-offs between performance and customization of BOFUSS.}

abstract = {Software Defined Networking (SDN) is the latest networking paradigm that espouses the separation of the control plane from the data plane for increased flexibility in the routing of flows through the network. Closely associated with SDN is OpenFlow, the most widely used protocol governing the information exchange between the data plane (switching devices) and the control plane (controller). The ease of implementing and testing new schemes in SDN has prompted many researchers to adopt the experimental and prototyping approach to validate their ideas. While the experimentation approach in validation has merits, analytical modelling provides valuable insights by making explicit the dependence of SDN performance on chosen parameters of interest. However, there is no exact queueing analysis of SDN with OpenFlow switches. In this paper, (i) we propose a queueing model of an OpenFlow–based SDN that takes into account classful treatment of packets arriving at a switch and (ii) provide an exact analysis of the proposed queueing model. In tandem, these two aspects have not been accurately modelled (if at all) by the handful of research done in this area. The proposed queueing model is validated by simulation and measurements on a test network and the prediction errors for simulation and measurements are lower than 2% and 10.5% respectively.}
